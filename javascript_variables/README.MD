### CONST

`const` keyword is used to assign values to variables, values assigned to these variables can not be changed.

```javascript
const age = 12;

 age ++; ‚ùå
```

### LET
The `let` keyword is used to declare and assign values to variables, values assigned to these variables can  be changed, unlike the `const`.

```javascript
let age;

age = 20;
```

### VAR
`var` keyword is used to declare variables more than once, the value can be overridden as much as possible. It adviceable not to use the `var` keyword at all, as it is very risky.

```javascript
var age = 10;
var age = 20;
var age = 30;

console.log(age); //30

```
